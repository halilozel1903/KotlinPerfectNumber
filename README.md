![Kotlin Perfect Number](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*TsSJhwB-3SJ6Df2CV_E7bQ.jpeg)

A `perfect` number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For example, `6` is a perfect number because its proper divisors (1, 2, 3) add up to 6.

Here‚Äôs an example `Kotlin` program that finds perfect numbers:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    (1..1000).filter { isPerfectNumber(it) }.forEach { println("$it is a perfect number") }
}

fun isPerfectNumber(number: Int): Boolean {
    return (1..number / 2).filter { number % it == 0 }.sum() == number
}
```
This code defines two functions: `main()` and `isPerfectNumber()`. The `main()` function is responsible for printing all perfect numbers from 1 to 1000. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors. For example, 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

The `isPerfectNumber()` function takes an integer number as input and returns `true` if number is a perfect number, and `false` otherwise. The function calculates the sum of the divisors of number and checks if it is equal to number.

When we run the program, it will output all the `perfect` numbers up to the limit we set:

```kotlin
6 is a perfect number
28 is a perfect number
496 is a perfect number
```
