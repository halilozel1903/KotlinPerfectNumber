## Kotlin Perfect Number 6Ô∏è‚É£ üåº üëπ

![Kotlin Perfect Number](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*TsSJhwB-3SJ6Df2CV_E7bQ.jpeg)

A `perfect` number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For example, `6` is a perfect number because its proper divisors (1, 2, 3) add up to 6.

Here‚Äôs an example `Kotlin` program that finds perfect numbers:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    for (i in 1..1000) {
        if (isPerfect(i)) {
            println("$i is a perfect number")
        }
    }
}

fun isPerfect(number: Int): Boolean {
    var sum = 0
    for (i in 1..number / 2) {
        if (number % i == 0) {
            sum += i
        }
    }
    return sum == number
}
```
In this program, we use a for loop to iterate through the numbers `1` to `1000`. For each number, we call the `isPerfect` function to determine if it's a perfect number. If isPerfect returns true, we print a message indicating that the number is a perfect number.

The `isPerfect` function takes an integer number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether number is a perfect number or not. To determine this, we use another for loop to iterate through the possible divisors of number. If a divisor is found, we add it to the sum variable. Finally, we return `true` if sum is equal to number, and `false` otherwise.

Note that this program only finds perfect numbers up to `1000`. You can adjust the range in the for loop in main to find perfect numbers in a larger range.

When we run the program, it will output all the `perfect` numbers up to the limit we set:

```kotlin
6 is a perfect number
28 is a perfect number
496 is a perfect number
```
